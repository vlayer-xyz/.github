# vlayer

[**vlayer**](https://vlayer.xyz) empowers developers to extract, verify, and integrate real‑world web data into smart contracts. Powered by advanced **Zero‑Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)** and **Multi‑Party Computation (MPC)**, vlayer enables cryptographic verification of website and API data without revealing any sensitive underlying information.

With **Web Proofs**, you gain a unified toolkit that supports:
* [**server‑side proving**](https://docs.vlayer.xyz/server-side/introduction) for REST API, GraphQL or OAUTH calls.
* [**client‑side proving**](https://docs.vlayer.xyz/client-side/introduction) via browser extension and mobile verifier apps for session‑based sites.
* [**ZK proving**](https://docs.vlayer.xyz/blockchain/introduction), compressing web proofs into zero-knowledge proofs so they can be verified on-chain.

## Example Use Case

Looking for a practical example? Check out the [**zk GitHub Contribution Verifier**](https://github.com/vlayer-xyz/zk-github-contribution-verifier), which demonstrates how to generate and verify GitHub contribution proofs using vlayer’s Web Proofs

## What is vouch?

[vouch](https://getvouch.io/) is a client-side proving system built on top of vlayer. It allows users to generate verifiable proofs from authenticated websites directly in their browser without exposing cookies, credentials, or private data.

Vouch enables:
- Privacy-preserving proofs tied to logged-in web sessions.
- Local TLS-based capture and proof generation via the browser extension.
- Simple verification by applications or smart contracts.
